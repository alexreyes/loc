# loc: a script to count lines of code changed per day

Obviously lines deleted/added is not a perfect measurement of code productivity. But I find it helpful for me personally to measure alongside total time spent focusing [(currently trying the CD method)](https://bookofhook.blogspot.com/2013/03/smart-guy-productivity-pitfalls.html)

The goal is to build some discipline around coding, cause rn I'm pretty inconsistent (i.e. the good days I do a lot, the bad days I do almost nothing. I want to make *some* progress daily even on the bad days!)


Currently I just have this script referenced in my `.zshrc` so that I can run `loc` in my terminal and then see what I've done that day/week.


### TODO (maybe):
- Add a UI with charts
- Count LOC changed across ALL directories
